# Gaussino with AdePT

This repository contains my workspace for experiments on the integration of AdePT as a physics library within Gaussino.

The idea is to reorganize here the work I've been doing so that I can easily run new experiments, systematically store and analyze
results and, be able to replicate whatever I need.
